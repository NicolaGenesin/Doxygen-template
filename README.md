##Doxygen-template

This is the Doxygen custom template I usually use on top of the CI environment.
In order to use it you have to define the INPUT tag into Doxyfile file.
Remember to exclude all the files that you don't want to analize.

This is a standalone tool in order to build the documentation on the fly.

###Simple usage:

> doxygen Doxyfile
